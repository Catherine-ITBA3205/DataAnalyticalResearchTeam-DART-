**Exploratory Data Analysis on Population Growth Rate of Philippines**

**INTRODUCTION**

The Philippines is one of the most populous countries in Southeast Asia and has also become an important international player due to its proximity to China. Still, the uncontrollable growth of the population in the Philippines now leads to overpopulation which became the root cause of all the problems that the country is currently facing. The most common problems that arise and need drastic solutions are pollution, lack of clean water, and resource depletion which also lead to serious issues such as poverty, diseases, and hunger. Due to this, many citizens of the country are forced to do immoral things in order to feed their families which increases the recorded crime rate. Based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data, as of Tuesday, April 5, 2022, the current population of the Philippines is 112,137,854. From the total land area of 298,170 Km2 (115,124 sq. miles), Philippines is ranked 13 in the list of countries (and dependencies) by population. Many individuals leave the country for jobs, in addition to escaping to urban commercial hubs. Every day, some 2,500 Filipinos leave the country for work in other countries, making the Philippines the world's second-largest labor exporter behind Mexico. According to POPCOM, Filipino workers abroad account for about ten percent of the country's population, or nearly eight million individuals. This is on top of the estimated 3 million illegal migrants working in other countries. Filipino workers abroad sent home $6.8 billion in 1999, according to official statistics from the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration. Women, who make up the majority of overseas Filipino workers, send a big percentage of these remittances.


The objective of this analysis is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Population Growth Rate of CALABARZON and provide policies that will help to decrease the negative effects.

The findings of this study will have a rebound effect to the benefit of society considering that this study aims to find solutions to the population growth rate in the Philippines, wherein population growth is one of the most common problems in our country.

**METHOD**

The researchers will be conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis on the data sets that are gathered in this study. This approach will be used in analyzing the data sets to summarize the cause and effect of the population growth in the CALABRZON. The graphical and statistical representations of the population growth in CALABRZON that will be made by this method of analysis will help the people in understanding the effects of overpopulation. The Exploratory Data Analysis will help the researchers in identifying the possible solutions, ideas and especially policies to prevent and help to control the population growth in CALABRZON.

**EXPECTED OUTPUT**

The goal of this project is to generate fact-based information that will be used to give awareness on the effects of the population growth rate towards the people in the community.
