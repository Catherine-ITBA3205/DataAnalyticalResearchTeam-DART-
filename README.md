**Exploratory Data Analysis on Population Growth Rate of Philippines**

**INTRODUCTION**

The Philippines is one of the most populous countries in Southeast Asia and has also become an important international player due to its proximity to China. Still, the uncontrollable growth of the population in the Philippines now leads to overpopulation which became the root cause of all the problems that the country is currently facing. The most common problems that arise and need drastic solutions are pollution, lack of clean water, and resource depletion which also lead to serious issues such as poverty, diseases, and hunger. Due to this, many citizens of the country are forced to do immoral things in order to feed their families which increases the recorded crime rate. Based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data, as of Tuesday, April 5, 2022, the current population of the Philippines is 112,137,854. From the total land area of 298,170 Km2 (115,124 sq. miles), Philippines is ranked 13 in the list of countries (and dependencies) by population. The Philippines is also one of the world's fastest urbanizing countries, with overcrowding causing its own set of problems. According to the country's Commission on Population, the country has more than 200 metropolitan centers with populations of more than 50,000 people, compared to 31% in Thailand and 16% in Cambodia (POPCOM). According to World Bank predictions, these urban centers might grow to 600 by 2020, owing to high levels of rural poverty driving people to cities.

The objective of this analysis is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Population Growth Rate of Philippines and provide policies that will help to decrease the negative effects. The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a way of evaluating datasets in order to summarize their essential properties, which is frequently done using visual approaches. Before beginning the modeling work, EDA is used to see what the data can tell us. In the Philippines, where the average number of children born to a woman is close to four and a sizable 37 percent of the population is under the age of 15, rapid population growth and rampant urbanization are two of the most pressing population challenges. These concerns are important roadblocks in the Philippines' efforts to alleviate poverty and enhance living standards. The Philippines is also one of the world's fastest urbanizing countries, with overcrowding posing its own set of problems.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**


**SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT**

The findings of this study will have a rebound effect to the benefit of society considering that this study aims to find solutions to the population growth rate in the Philippines, wherein population growth is one of the most common problems in our country. Many Filipinos may face the following consequences as a result of this: unemployment, which causes poverty, a lack of food supply, which causes malnutrition, a large number of out-of-school youth in the community, and the arousal of many crimes in the community.

This study will provide the Filipino people, especially to the people in the Philippines, to become aware of the effects of population growth rate and on what they are going to do to stop this population growth rate in their community. By analyzing datasets and summarizing main characteristics, the researchers will be able to make more accurate analysis about population levels and growth rates. Researchers can learn more about what causes changes in population sizes and growth rates by studying population growth. They can also learn more about how individuals communicate with each other and their environments by studying population growth. This is particularly important when contemplating the potential effects of climate change and other environmental changes.


**METHOD**

The researchers will be conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis on the data sets that are gathered in this study. This approach will be used in analyzing the data sets to summarize the cause and effect of the population growth in the CALABRZON. The graphical and statistical representations of the population growth in CALABRZON that will be made by this method of analysis will help the people in understanding the effects of overpopulation. The Exploratory Data Analysis will help the researchers in identifying the possible solutions, ideas and especially policies to prevent and help to control the population growth in CALABRZON.

**EXPECTED OUTPUT**

The goal of this project is to generate fact-based information that will be used to give awareness on the effects of the population growth rate towards the people in the community. Whereas the people living in Philippines would be able to take steps about the growing population rate. This project would give them information about the effects that comes along the growth rate. Also, this project would help convey to the people about the policies on how to decrease the growth rate such as programs that would help reduce the effects on the community and the people as well.
