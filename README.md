**Exploratory Data Analysis on Population Growth Rate of CALABARZON**

**INTRODUCTION**

The Philippines is one of the most populous countries in Southeast Asia and has also become an important international player due to its proximity to China. Still, the uncontrollable growth of the population in the Philippines now leads to overpopulation which became the root cause of all the problems that the country is currently facing. The most common problems that arise and need drastic solutions are pollution, lack of clean water, and resource depletion which also lead to serious issues such as poverty, diseases, and hunger. Due to this many citizens of the country are forced to do immoral things in order to feed their families which increases the recorded crime rate. The drastic growth of population in the Philippines, specifically in the region of CALABARZON, increased by 1,780,268 people from the previous population of 14,414,774 in the year 2015. Out of the 17 administrative regions, Region IV-A (CALABARZON) had the biggest population in 2020 with 16.20 million. One of the existing solutions that the government is implementing to help decrease the rapid growth of the population in the country is by offering its citizens to undergo family planning and the use of contraceptives in order to avoid unwanted pregnancy.

The objective of this analysis is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Population Growth Rate of CALABARZON and provide policies that will help to decrease the negative effects.
