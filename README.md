**Exploratory Data Analysis of the Population Growth Rate in the Philippines**

**INTRODUCTION**

The Philippines as a third world country has been facing many different challenges such as poverty, terrorism, war against drug and the likes. According to worldpopulationview.com the Philippines ranked as the 13th most populated country in the world, and 7th in Southeast Asia. It has also become an important international player due to its proximity to China. According to recent census, provided by the Philippine Statistics Authority, from May 2000 to May 2020, there is a huge increase in population from 76,506,928 to 109,035,343. A total of 32,528,415 increase in population in just 22 years. And Based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data, as of Tuesday, April 5, 2022, the current population of the Philippines is 112,137,854. From the total land area of 298,170 Km2 (115,124 sq. miles). Due to the uncontrollable rapid growth of the population in the Philippines it caused overpopulation which became the root cause of all the problems that the country is currently facing. The most common problems that arise and needs drastic solutions are pollution, lack of clean water, and resource depletion which also lead to serious issues such as poverty, diseases, and hunger. Because of this, many citizens of the country are forced to do immoral things in order to feed their families which increases the recorded crime rate. The Philippines is also one of the world's fastest urbanizing countries, with overcrowding causing its own set of problems. According to the country's Commission on Population, the country has more than 200 metropolitan centers with populations of more than 50,000 people, compared to 31% in Thailand and 16% in Cambodia (POPCOM). According to World Bank predictions, these urban centers might grow to 600 by 2020, owing to high levels of rural poverty driving people to cities.

The objective of this analysis is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Population Growth Rate of Philippines and provide policies that will help to decrease the negative effects. The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a way of evaluating datasets in order to summarize their essential properties, which is frequently done using visual approaches. Before beginning the modeling work, EDA is used to see what the data can tell us. In the Philippines, where the average number of children born to a woman is close to four and a sizable 37 percent of the population is under the age of 15, rapid population growth and rampant urbanization are two of the most pressing population challenges. These concerns are important roadblocks in the Philippines' efforts to alleviate poverty and enhance living standards. The Philippines is also one of the world's fastest urbanizing countries, with overcrowding posing its own set of problems.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

The primary issue that this project would tackle is the increasing population rate in the Philippines and how it is affecting the daily lives of the Filipino people. Up to this day the Philippine Government still doesn't have a concrete plan on how to control the rapidly increasing population in the Philippines aside from Republic Act 10345: Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 that states to eradicate discriminatory practices, laws and policies that infringe on a person's exercise of reproductive health rights. Although there are Laws that are implemented to spread awareness to the right of the people regarding their Reproductive Health, these laws are still not enough or it is not properly and strongly implemented as it is still visually seen that the over growing population of the Philippines is still not under control unlike their neighboring countries that strongly implement laws such as a One-Child Policy Law. Because of this, this project seeks to provide policies that should be implemented in order to decrease or slow down the over growing population of the Philippines and lessen its negative impact.

**SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT**

This study will cover the issue of the population growth rate in the Philippines.

 This will benefits the following:

**•	To the Government.** The result of the study will help the government for the improvement of their policies about the population growth rate in the Philippines. This study will benefit them by providing analysis and insights about population growth rate in the Philippines. With this, they will be conscious of what will be the reason for the continuous population growth in the Philippines and have an idea of what they can do for the betterment of our country.

**•	To the citizens.** This will spread awareness to them on recognizing the population growth rate as the root cause of many problems our country faces. This study will be helpful to the citizens because it will allow them to gain knowledge on the various solutions that they may use to control the population growth rate. By analyzing datasets and summarizing main characteristics, the researchers will be able to make more accurate analysis about population levels and growth rates.

**•	To the future researchers.** The result of this study can be used for future discussions and serve as a useful reference on the population growth rate in the Philippines.



**METHOD**

The researchers will be conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis on the data sets that are gathered in this study. This approach will be used in analyzing the data sets to summarize the cause and effect of the population growth in the Philippines. The graphical and statistical representations of the population growth in the Philippines that will be made by this method of analysis will help the people in understanding the effects of overpopulation. The Exploratory Data Analysis will help the researchers in identifying the possible solutions, ideas and especially policies to prevent and help to control the population growth in the Philippines.

**EXPECTED OUTPUT**

The goal of this project is to generate fact-based information that will be used to give awareness on the effects of the population growth rate towards the people in the community. Whereas the people living in Philippines would be able to take steps about the growing population rate. This project would give them information about the effects that comes along the growth rate. Also, this project would help convey to the people about the policies on how to decrease the growth rate such as programs that would help reduce the effects on the community and the people as well.
