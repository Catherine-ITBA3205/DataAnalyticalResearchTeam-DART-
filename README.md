**INTRODUCTION**

The Philippines as a third world country have faced many different challenges and one of the most evident is overpopulation. According to worldpopulationview.com the Philippines ranked as the 13th most populated country in the world, and 7th in Southeast Asia. It has also become an important international player due to its proximity to China. According to a recent census, provided by the Philippine Statistics Authority, from May 2000 to May 2020, there is a huge increase in population from 76,506,928 to 109,035,343. A total of 32,528,415 increase in population in just 22 years. And based on Worldometer elaboration of the latest United Nations data, as of Tuesday, April 5, 2022, the current population of the Philippines is 112,137,854. Due to the uncontrollable rapid growth of the population in the Philippines, it caused overpopulation which became the root cause of all the problems that the country is currently facing. Because of this, many citizens of the country are forced to do immoral things in order to feed their families which increases the recorded crime rate. The Philippines is also one of the world's fastest urbanizing countries, with overcrowding causing its own set of problems. According to the country's Commission on Population, the country has more than 200 metropolitan centers with populations of more than 50,000 people, compared to 31% in Thailand and 16% in Cambodia (POPCOM). According to World Bank estimates, the number of urban centers in these areas might reach 600 by 2020, as a result of high levels of rural poverty forcing people to cities.

The Philippines ranks 68th out of 116 nations with enough data to compute 2021 GHI rankings within the Global Hunger Index. According to the 3rd quarter 2019 Social Weather Stations (SWS) survey results, which were collected between September 27 and 30, 2019, 9.1 percent, or an estimated 2.3 million families, encountered involuntary hunger at least once in the previous three months. The Philippines encompasses a moderate level of hunger, with a score of 16.8. That’s why President Rodrigo Duterte has established an inter-agency task force on zero hunger to assist more Filipinos overcome hunger and achieve food security. The Inter-Agency Task Force on Zero Hunger will develop a "National Food Policy" that will explain the government's goals and actions to accomplish hunger eradication. Initiatives to cut back on hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture are identified through the NFP. The task force is charged with developing a National Food Policy (NFP), which can lay out national priorities supported by a radical understanding of the difficulty of hunger and related issues, as a roadmap for achieving zero hunger, taking under consideration existing laws and issuances, such as jurisprudence and treaty obligations.


The objective of this analysis is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis on the Population Growth Rate in the Philippines and provide policies that will help to decrease the negative effects which is poverty and how it is leading to Filipino families suffering from hunger. The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a way of evaluating datasets in order to summarize their essential properties, which is frequently done using visual approaches. Before beginning the modeling work, EDA is used to see what the data can tell us. Rapid population growth and the percantage of Filipino families suffering from Hunger are two of the most significant demographic concerns in the Philippines, where the average number of children born to a woman is close to four and a large 37 percent of the population is under the age of 15 which results to overpopulation, less job opportunities, unemployed and low income Filipino families, that leads to hunger.These concerns are important roadblocks in the Philippines' efforts to increase the economic growth of the country and help the Filipino people to have a good and sustainable life.


**Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**

This project intends to achieve the United Nation's agenda entitled Sustainable Development Goals specifically it seeks to achieve the second goal which is **_Zero hunger, and Sustainable Cities and Communities._**

**Goal 2: Zero Hunger** – To seek long-term solutions to end all forms of hunger by 2030 and achieve food security, the goal is to ensure that everybody, everywhere has enough nutritious food to live a healthy life. Achieving this goal will necessitate improved food access and widespread promotion of sustainable agriculture. And to end hunger and ensure that people, particularly the poor and those in vulnerable situations, including infants, have year-round access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food.

**Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities** - Rapid urbanization, owing to rising populations and migration, has resulted in a growth in megacities, particularly in developing countries, and slums are becoming a more prominent component of urban life. Attempts to build and develop cities and other human habitation so that everyone has access to essential services, electricity, housing, transportation, and green public areas while reducing resource use and environmental effect.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

> The primary issue that this project would tackle is the zero hunger rate in the Philippines and how it is affecting the population in the country.

> This project seeks to provide policies that should be implemented in order to decrease or slow down the growing population of the Philippines and help lessen and decrease the rate of Filipino families that suffers from hunger.

**SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT**

This study will cover the issue of the population growth rate in the Philippines, and it's relationship with the growing rapid urbanization in the country. 

 This will benefits the following:

**•	To the Government.** The result of the study will help the government for the improvement of their policies about the population growth rate in the Philippines. This study will benefit them by providing analysis and insights about population growth rate in the Philippines. With this, they will be conscious of what will be the reason for the continuous population growth in the Philippines and have an idea of what they can do for the betterment of our country.

**•	To the citizens.** This will spread awareness to them on recognizing the population growth rate as the root cause of many problems our country faces. This study will be helpful to the citizens because it will allow them to gain knowledge on the various solutions that they may use to control the population growth rate. By analyzing datasets and summarizing main characteristics, the researchers will be able to make more accurate analysis about population levels and growth rates.

**•	To the future researchers.** The result of this study can be used for future discussions and serve as a useful reference on the population growth rate in the Philippines.



**METHOD**

To analyze the population growth rate in the Philippines, the researchers will be using datasets provided by the Philippine Statistics Authority. This study will be using the datasets that include population rate and average household size in the Philippines for the reason that this is one of the outcomes of population growth in the Philippines. The researchers will be using data visualization techniques to study and investigate data sets and highlight their primary characteristics in an exploratory data analysis. The graphical and statistical representations of the population growth in the Philippines that will be made by this method of analysis will help the people in understanding the effects of overpopulation. The Exploratory Data Analysis will help the researchers in identifying the possible solutions, ideas and especially policies to prevent and help to control the population growth in the Philippines.

**EXPECTED OUTPUT**

The goal of this project is to generate fact-based information that will be used to give awareness on the effects of the population growth rate towards the people in the community. Whereas the people living in Philippines would be able to take steps about the growing population rate. This project would give them information about the effects that comes along the growth rate. Also, this project would help convey to the people about the policies on how to decrease the growth rate such as programs that would help reduce the effects on the community and the people as well.
